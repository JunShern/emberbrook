# DAYLOG — 2026-07-30 (day shift)

Timekeeping for the day slate, same convention as NIGHTLOG: every agent appends
timestamped milestones here (append-only; commit with your other files).

Slate (user-ratified this morning):
- COORDINATOR: combat-ecosystem design + schemas + state store; play3d.html
  gatekeeping; integration; final vertical-loop playtest.
- TOWN CUSTODIAN (sole master-blend owner today): lockhead station + empty-bank
  build, then legibility bucket-1 (rails/channeling) from audit findings.
- LEGIBILITY AUDITOR: route data + dev overlay + 18-shot audit + review page.
  Mandate includes proposing town-model re-architecture (user granted creative
  freedom; blend execution routes through the custodian).
- BATTLE CORE (T+design): rules layer, turn-based v1, router, encounter director.
- ECONOMY (T+design): shops, pause menu, save/load.

Canon set this morning: Odessa = senior lockkeeper (village-chief-like), lives at
Keepers' Cottage with daughter Maren; lockhead = her working STATION, not a hut.

------------------------------------------------------------
10:5x COORDINATOR: slate launched. Character canon fixed in map (Odessa+Maren at
      Keepers' Cottage, lockhead = staffed post; commit c15fff5). Design spine
      committed (e964e80): combat-ecosystem.md, rules data (6 monsters keyed to
      zones, 14 items, per-zone encounter tables w/ safe roads, growth curve
      k=25 w/ Vesper+Maren party-of-N, 3 shops), GS state store, play3d module
      hooks (game_state.js + route_overlay.js stub). Slice regression with hooks
      live: 532/0. FOUR AGENTS RUNNING: town custodian (lockhead station +
      empty-bank build), legibility auditor (routes/overlay/audit), battle core
      (rules kernel + turn-based v1 + encounter director), economy (shops +
      menu + save). All under design-first orders; check-ins on the 10-min tick
      cadence.

## LEGIBILITY AUDITOR

14:35 DESIGN NOTE committed: docs/plans/legibility-audit-design.md. Position taken
        (coordinator ruling welcome): route polylines are DERIVED, not hand-authored —
        dellhollow.map.json's 38 typed walk edges ARE the intended route (the 315 walk
        meshes were generated from them and are wider by construction, which is the
        plan's own diagnosis), and cameras.json `owns.edges` (with @t0..t1 fractions)
        already says which route belongs to which shot. Generator
        tools/routes_derive.mjs reuses tools/cine_regions.mjs so ownership/projection
        have no second implementation; per-shot `overrides` keep it hand-editable;
        `--check` fails on staleness like cine_solve/scenegraph_derive. Generalises to
        Emberbrook and every future town with no authoring pass.
        Rubric: 6 measured signals (entry-visible / exit-visible / exit-flow /
        route-visible / route-distinct / no-fall-off) then the user's question;
        occlusion measured by gl.readPixels against the shot's own baked depth, not
        judged by eye. Fix buckets 1-4 incl. model re-architecture.

## TOWN CUSTODIAN

14:40 BASELINES + DESIGN NOTE. Region baselines taken BEFORE touching anything
        (region 74,90,10,22):
        * master_walk_qa.py — 367/367 identity bit-identical (worst vertex delta
          0.000e+00); ray coverage 242 samples, 239 on a walk mesh (98.76%), 19
          buried skipped; FAILED (2) ALREADY, both pre-existing: non-walk first
          hits e_lockhead__lock-five_rung00 x3, headroom lm_lockhead x4 (1.65%)
          + e_lockhead__lock-five_rung00 x3 (1.24%). 296 walks render-hidden
          town-wide.
        * geometry_audit.py — 73 meshes in region, 18 bbox-overlapping pairs,
          0 intersection offenders, 0 strays.
        DESIGN NOTE committed: docs/plans/lockhead-station-design.md. The
        measurement it adds to lockhead-prep.md: with walk_/bar_/lm_ masked, the
        route's NORTH half (approach + pad, y>15.6) and the WHOLE descending route
        to the Keepers' Cottage (..._l0..l5) hang 1..3.7 m over bare lf_ground with
        no art at all. So the "ribbon debt" is not a 10-line flag — hiding those
        ribbons without structure would swap a gray ribbon for INVISIBLE FLOOR over
        a 12 m drop. Paying it with structure: lk_paving (bedded half), lk_planking/
        lk_joists/lk_bearers (the jetty the parcel camera's own note describes),
        lk_boardwalk (the cottage descent), lk_bankface (cut-bank revetment + kerb),
        lk_rail (rim rail, VISUAL, gap at the ladder head), lk_station/lk_mast/
        lk_bell/lk_brazier (Odessa's post, NOT enterable, no map change needed),
        lk_clut, veg_lk_*, two 680 W practicals.

## BATTLE CORE

14:40 DESIGN DOC committed: docs/plans/battle-core-design.md. State/action/event
        shapes, scheduler policy interface, router API, screen sketch, sim
        scenarios. Both standing swap tests answered YES in writing (an ATB or
        real-time scheduler needs no change to battle_rules.js or the router,
        because the kernel's unit of work is ONE ACTION not one round, and the
        router is read per decision; Battle.start can be reimplemented real-time
        because the overworld's whole surface is `Battle.active` + the promise +
        the result — xp/gold/drops are reported, never applied).
        THREE RED-TEAM FINDINGS raised to main before working around them:
        (a) `chancePerStep` cannot be per physics tick — 0.02/tick at 60 Hz with
        SPD 0.075 is a battle every 0.83 s. A "step" is therefore defined as 1.0
        world unit of travel, accumulated by the director from getPos() itself
        (so the movement hook is a zero-arg Encounters.tick(), and the JSON
        numbers survive an SPD retune). grace 30 = 30 u; mean meadow gap 50 u on
        a 280 u tile.
        (b) `mean turns 3-6` looks unreachable at party-of-1: level-1 Vesper
        (atk 9 w/ staff) deals 14-18 to a 16 HP reed-nibbler, ~60 % one-shot, so
        the single-nibbler group ends in ~1.4 rounds. Measured table + a
        monsters.json HP proposal follow from the sim; the envelope stays a test
        either way.
        (c) GS has no HP setter, so v1 defeat-revive uses a second
        applyBattleResult({outcome:'defeat',partyHp:{...:1}}) — public API only —
        and requests GS.setHp(charId,hp). Also flagged: Rules.derive.charStats
        duplicates GS.stats math because the kernel must run in node without GS;
        the clean fix is GS.stats delegating to the kernel.

## ECONOMY

14:52 DESIGN NOTE committed: docs/plans/economy-design.md. Shape: every module
        splits DATA -> OPS (pure, GS-only, headless-testable) -> VIEW (keyboard
        DOM overlay), so tools/economy_test.mjs tests the code the UI actually
        runs instead of a re-implementation. Third file public/js/ui_kit.js
        (window.EBUI) holds the shared overlay/cursor/input-lock so shop and menu
        cannot drift apart and a battle menu inherits the feel.
        NO COORDINATES IN CODE, copying the scene graph's own rule: the shop is
        matched by shops.json sceneKey (verified against scenegraph.json nodes —
        all three match), the interaction region IS the interior's own
        walk_pad_counter mesh (every interior builder emits one; box test, not a
        circle, because the pad is 1.7x1.0m), the label is "Talk to the " +
        shops.json keeper, and the banner is a clone of sgPrompt's recipe
        (promptFmt/key/vTol read from the graph's own defaults).
        Anchor chain: requested SIM.pad('walk_pad_counter') hook > optional
        shops.json counter field > a GLB-derived fallback table that works today.
        PAUSE WITHOUT TOUCHING play3d: capture-phase key listener on window +
        SIM.keys({}) zeroing = a real pause with zero coordinator dependency;
        window.UILOCK is consulted too if the formal hook lands.
        Key bindings: E at counter (identical to doors), Esc for the pause menu
        (free — play3d uses g/2/[/]/m/z and M is already the dev settings menu),
        arrows AND WASD for the cursor (either couch seat can drive), E/Enter
        confirm, Esc/Q back. Red-team answers in §7: six chapter-3 shops = a
        shops.json edit only; Maren joining = activeParty() gaining a row, no
        code change.
11:1x COORDINATOR CHECK-IN 1: battle-core + economy design docs reviewed and
      approved (both answered the swap tests in writing). Rulings (full log in
      combat-ecosystem.md): encounter step = 1.0u travel; meadow envelope
      relaxed to 1-4 turns at party-of-1 (monsters stay cheap); schedulers+AI
      live in the kernel as pure injectables so battle_sim tests the SHIPPING
      engine. Grants shipped (783c621): GS.setHp + GS.useItem, GS.stats
      delegates to Rules.derive.charStats (one impl of character math), UILOCK
      modal-input contract in play3d (phys freeze + key guards, replaces both
      agents' bespoke freeze tricks), SIM.pad. Slice regression after play3d
      edits: 532/0. Both agents messaged with rulings; battle menus to evaluate
      reusing economy's EBUI ui_kit.

15:2x BATTLE CORE — ALL FIVE FILES LANDED (1,554 lines of module + 514 of harness).
        public/js/battle_rules.js (520) pure kernel: mulberry32 + FNV-1a hashSeed,
        damage=max(1,round((atk*2-def)*U(0.85,1.15))), spd order w/ authored-index
        tie-break, applyAction returning {state,events} with DETERMINISTIC
        retargeting, rewards(), derive.* (charStats is now GS.stats's one
        implementation), makeRouter, policies.partyAi/monsterAi,
        schedulers.commitThenResolve, engine.run/result. Node + browser.
        public/js/battle_turnbased.js (741) window.Battle: full-bleed FF screen
        (per-zone gradient backdrop table, family-keyed CSS silhouettes, floating
        damage numbers, HP bars, log line, Attack/Item/Flee cursor, victory/defeat/
        flee outro), 350ms veil matching sgFade, UILOCK held, ONE capture-phase key
        listener gated on Battle.active, GS.removeItem-only item consumption.
        public/js/encounters.js (282) window.Encounters: distance-accumulating
        director, per-zone grace re-armed on attach/zone-change/post-battle/
        teleport(>3u), seeded per-step rolls, weighted group pick, defeat policy
        (1 HP + half purse + respawn at anchor), self-attaches to SIM so the only
        hook is a zero-arg tick().
        tools/battle_sim.mjs (289) + tools/encounter_sim.mjs (225).
        MEASURED CADENCE (4000 runs/zone, confirms the 1.0u ruling): meadow mean
        gap 80.2 u = 17.8 s of walking, median 65, p10-p90 36-144, 3.5 encounters
        per 280 u tile crossing; forest 48.9 u; crag 53.4 u; water 58.9 u; road
        SAFE. Verified the per-step seeding is unbiased (P(first draw<0.02)
        measured 0.02008 over 2e6 fresh seeds) — a fresh mulberry32 per step is
        sound, so a walk is replayable.
        encounter_sim.mjs GREEN, 21/21: it loads the REAL game_state.js under a
        fetch stub (no DOM) and proves the vertical loop closes headlessly —
        GS.stats === Rules.derive.charStats, Battle.start returns a victory and
        applies NOTHING to the world, GS.applyBattleResult is what moves gold, a
        mid-battle router.set() moves the seat on the very next decision, road and
        UNKNOWN zones are safe, steps track distance not ticks (799 steps in 800u),
        one run seed replays one walk, a 40 u jump re-arms grace, and the director
        is inert with a reason when Battle is missing.
        battle_sim.mjs: 6/6 engine property tests pass (determinism, seed
        sensitivity, applyAction purity, retargeting, collection-order
        independence, termination under a round cap). BALANCE: 20 of 22 envelopes
        green on committed data; forest-2 [duskpad+duskpad] wins 0.0% and forest-4
        [bramble-shade+duskpad] 17.5% at level 1 — CERTAIN DEATH, not danger.
        Tuning request sent to main (atk-only, measured): duskpad 8->6,
        bramble-shade 9->7, weir-eel 9->7 makes every envelope green while leaving
        the forest expensive (11-25 HP of 34 left) — awaiting the grant, no data
        file touched.
11:4x COORDINATOR CHECK-IN 2: battle-core kernel live, verified identical to GS
      math via the delegation signature. It cross-reviewed and caught TWO live
      integration bugs node --check can't see: (1) MY phys() UILOCK early
      return broke loop()'s destructure — every frame threw while a panel was
      open and the world stopped rendering; fixed f760304 (frozen shape
      returned, sgTick still skipped, slice 532/0). (2) economy's ui_kit
      panel() calls setUilock/zeroMovement which don't exist — shop/menu can't
      open; fix ordered, plus a ruled locked() guard in their globals dispatch
      so shop/pause/battle are mutually exclusive by construction. Rulings 7-8
      added to combat-ecosystem.md (in-battle items bypass GS.useItem by
      design; UILOCK modal exclusion). Battle tags will precede ui_kit at hook
      time. EBUI reuse verdict approved (pure half only).

15:41 SHIPPED (2448f47): public/js/ui_kit.js (293), public/js/shop.js (398),
        public/js/menu.js (397), tools/economy_test.mjs (512).
        economy_test: 204 passed, 0 failed. node --check clean on all four.
        All three coordinator grants consumed: SIM.pad means shop.js holds ZERO
        coordinates for any shop (anchor derived from the interior's own
        walk_pad_counter at runtime; the GLB-derived fallback table survives only
        as the no-hook path). GS.useItem means the planned heal shim was never
        written — Menu.useItem is a one-line delegation, so menu item use and
        battle item use cannot diverge. UILOCK('shop')/('menu') is what pauses
        the world; EBUI's capture listener now only routes keys to the top panel
        and kills browser defaults. Ruled requirement adopted: global keys are
        suppressed whenever UILOCK is active, so shop / pause menu / battle are
        mutually exclusive BY CONSTRUCTION (Esc in a shop closes the shop, never
        stacks a menu; the menu refuses to open over a battle) — asserted, not
        assumed.
        TEST NOTE worth borrowing: sections 15-16 drive both UIs through a DOM
        stub with SYNTHESISED KEYSTROKES — prompt arms, panel opens, list walks,
        qty step, a real purchase, a sell-back, every menu screen, save/load
        confirms. node --check cannot see a call to a function that does not
        exist, and OPS-only tests never enter the view; two such ReferenceErrors
        were caught in cross-agent review before those sections existed, and this
        is the regression guard for that whole class.
        Two bugs found in the data/state layer, both reported and none worked
        around: none. Shop sceneKeys and scenegraph nodes agree exactly.
11:5x COORDINATOR: economy VERIFIED INDEPENDENTLY (204/0 rerun by me, syntax
      clean, no stale refs — the "bug A" battle-core saw was a mid-edit
      snapshot of an untracked file; committed tree is clean) and INTEGRATED:
      ui_kit/shop/menu tags live in play3d (battle tags slot reserved before
      ui_kit), Shop.tick() rides the physics tick like sgTick. Slice 532/0
      with shops+menu armed. The pause menu, shops, and save/load are now LIVE
      in the game. Remaining: battle-core hooks, custodian + auditor reports.
12:1x COORDINATOR: BATTLE IS LIVE. Granted the measured tuning (3 atk cuts;
      forest-2 went 0/500 wins -> 100% @4.88 rounds with real attrition) PLUS
      the optional scree-shell atk 9 — crag at 78/73% win with tonics spent is
      danger, not grind; queued for tonight's taste board. Hooks applied: 3
      battle tags before ui_kit, Encounters.tick() on the physics tick after
      sgTick. Full regression green: battle_sim all envelopes (both levels),
      encounter_sim 21/21, slice 532/0, cine 667/0. Water zone ruling: bank
      cells ARE reachable (dock/moorage/weir), eel stays live content,
      envelope stays advisory. NEXT: coordinator browser playtest of the full
      vertical loop, then custodian/auditor integration.
15:10 ROUTE DATA + OVERLAY + 17-SHOT AUDIT LANDED.
        public/townmap/dellhollow.routes.json (new, derived by tools/routes_derive.mjs):
        17 shots, 50 entries, 49 exits, 59 routes, 432 m of intended route, each point
        carrying its scenegraph edge and its projection into the shot's frame. Also
        reports 76.5 m over 17 spans where the floor you walk is owned by a DIFFERENT
        shot than the camera that is up (a cutOffset consequence — where sgCorrect can
        fire and where authored cuts land late).
        public/js/route_overlay.js: R toggles (Shift+R adds an all-shots step), entries
        green, exits orange WITH their real trigger bands and leave-direction arrows,
        route ribbons + spur/blocked language, in-scene sprite labels (so they survive
        readPixels and canvas captures). Lazy, additive, depth-honest, never touches game
        state. window.ROUTES exposes the instrument: probe() measures per-point visibility
        by GL readback against each shot's own baked depth map; dropEdges() finds
        unprotected fall-off with coordinates.
        AUDIT: 3 GREEN / 5 AMBER / 9 RED. Review board:
        docs/qa/review/legibility-audit.html (overlay + clean plate + measured numbers +
        defects + bucketed fix per shot; raw records in docs/qa/review/probe/*.json).
        WORST: cottage-steps — the "eight-metre flight" is DISCONNECTED FLOATING PLANK
        SLABS; there is no stair in the frame, only walkmesh (bucket 4, zoom exhibit).
        WORST BY IMPACT: gate + shelf-west — in the town's first two shots the rim
        canopy sits between camera and road, so the only way INTO Dellhollow measures
        0% visible and both onward seams in the shop street measure 0%.
        SYSTEMIC: cine_solve frames every ARRIVAL but never the SEAM IT IS AN EXIT OF —
        5 exits sit outside their own frame (worst cottage, ndc y -1.37). Redline
        proposed: add each shot's outgoing seam centres to the solver's sample set.
        Fall-off measured across the town: 91 unprotected places, worst weave (19,
        incl. one bottomless at 59.69,12.47,-18.14) and cottage (12, four 16-18 m falls
        within 0.9 m of the path). Rubric amendment flagged: fall-off scored SEPARATELY
        from the verdict, else it flattens every shot to AMBER.
        Gates re-run before commit: cine_test 667/0, slice_test 532/0,
        routes_derive --check ok. play3d.html untouched (hook was already in place).

## BATTLE CORE

15:5x GREEN ON RATIFIED DATA + BALANCE KNOWLEDGE WRITTEN DOWN. With the granted
        atk tuning applied by the coordinator (0ef8b42) and the hooks live,
        battle_sim.mjs is ALL ENVELOPES GREEN at n=500 for levels 1 and 2, engine
        property tests 6/6; encounter_sim.mjs 21/21. Level-1 table on shipped
        data: meadow 100% @1.40/2.84/1.00 rounds; forest 100% @2.00/4.88/1.83/
        3.89 (forest-4 leaves 11.3/34 HP — the intended attrition); crag 77.8%
        and 74.4% with 0.77/1.71 tonics spent (dangerous, as mandated, after the
        scree-shell atk 7->9 the coordinator adopted); water 100% @2.00/3.00.
        DESIGN DOC UPDATED (docs/plans/battle-core-design.md): all three red-team
        findings now carry their RESOLUTION inline so the doc reads as settled,
        §10 rewritten to the ratified per-zone envelopes + the six engine property
        tests, and a new §11 "BALANCE DIAL CHARACTERIZATION" — the systemic
        finding that must outlive this session:
        with E = 2*atk - def, a fight is won iff Sum(foeHP)/E_party <
        partyHP/Sum(E_foe), and at level-1 integers that is a STEP FUNCTION of
        monster atk. Measured cliff: duskpad atk 8 -> 0.0% win, atk 7 -> 19.0%,
        atk 6 -> 100%, with no integer in between, while level 2 wins 100% at all
        three. Dial resolution, coarse to fine: monster atk (2 damage/point,
        AVOID) > party def (1/point, party-wide) > monster HP (fight LENGTH only,
        safest) > group size/weights (the real difficulty dial, non-linear).
        House rules recorded: author HP-first from a target round count, never
        propose an atk change without --tune measuring it, balance depends on
        party SIZE more than level (Maren joining loosens every envelope at once),
        a heal item only helps while Sum(E_foe) < heal per round (which is exactly
        why the untuned duskpad pair was unwinnable rather than hard — the AI
        drank and still died), and danger belongs in spd as much as atk (measured
        escape chances: scree shell 69%, nibbler 57%, duskpad pair 39%, sprite
        33%, weir eel 21% — the eel is frightening because you cannot leave).
15:20 GENERALITY VERIFIED + design note amended. The same dellhollow.routes.json drawn
        in townwalk (a real-time scene with NO shots): the overlay resolved its data file
        from the scene graph's own provenance, found no shot, and drew the whole town —
        50 entries / 49 exits / 432 m at once (appendix on the review page). collide,
        walkRef and allMeshes identical before and after the overlay is on, which is the
        "never touches game state" claim measured rather than asserted. Emberbrook needs
        one generator run and no code change. Design note §4b records the three rubric
        amendments made in the doing (fall-off scored separately; visibility measured at
        surface AND chest height; exit-offscreen split into ground vs figure).
12:5x COORDINATOR VERTICAL-LOOP PLAYTEST — THE LOOP CLOSES (browser, real tab):
      director forest battle -> victory -> 13xp/9g/pelt APPLIED; organic
      water-zone encounter via real SIM walking (eel+sprite ambush, out at
      5/34hp, 24xp/16g applied); Esc suppressed under battle lock; menu shows
      live stats+equip deltas; GS.save survived scene change into the
      chandlery; counter prompt -> shop -> bought tonic 46->34g; useItem
      healed 29 w/ max clamp; GS.reset cleanup. HARNESS CANON: hidden-tab
      intensive throttling => automated battles need battleOpts speed:0.
      REFINEMENT NOTE filed w/ battle-core: zone-boundary grace farming.
      AUDIT TRIAGED: custodian gets 4 geometry items (probe coords as spec,
      auditor instrument as acceptance); fresh agent on cine_solve exit-seam
      delta report (boatyard PINNED for user ruling; NO bake until custodian
      geometry lands — one bake, one freshness state). Auditor transcript
      expired (known); successor briefed on written handover. Battle-core +
      economy + audit tasks CLOSED. Custodian progress snapshot requested.
