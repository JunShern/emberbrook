# DAYLOG — 2026-07-30 (day shift)

Timekeeping for the day slate, same convention as NIGHTLOG: every agent appends
timestamped milestones here (append-only; commit with your other files).

Slate (user-ratified this morning):
- COORDINATOR: combat-ecosystem design + schemas + state store; play3d.html
  gatekeeping; integration; final vertical-loop playtest.
- TOWN CUSTODIAN (sole master-blend owner today): lockhead station + empty-bank
  build, then legibility bucket-1 (rails/channeling) from audit findings.
- LEGIBILITY AUDITOR: route data + dev overlay + 18-shot audit + review page.
  Mandate includes proposing town-model re-architecture (user granted creative
  freedom; blend execution routes through the custodian).
- BATTLE CORE (T+design): rules layer, turn-based v1, router, encounter director.
- ECONOMY (T+design): shops, pause menu, save/load.

Canon set this morning: Odessa = senior lockkeeper (village-chief-like), lives at
Keepers' Cottage with daughter Maren; lockhead = her working STATION, not a hut.

------------------------------------------------------------
10:5x COORDINATOR: slate launched. Character canon fixed in map (Odessa+Maren at
      Keepers' Cottage, lockhead = staffed post; commit c15fff5). Design spine
      committed (e964e80): combat-ecosystem.md, rules data (6 monsters keyed to
      zones, 14 items, per-zone encounter tables w/ safe roads, growth curve
      k=25 w/ Vesper+Maren party-of-N, 3 shops), GS state store, play3d module
      hooks (game_state.js + route_overlay.js stub). Slice regression with hooks
      live: 532/0. FOUR AGENTS RUNNING: town custodian (lockhead station +
      empty-bank build), legibility auditor (routes/overlay/audit), battle core
      (rules kernel + turn-based v1 + encounter director), economy (shops +
      menu + save). All under design-first orders; check-ins on the 10-min tick
      cadence.

## LEGIBILITY AUDITOR

14:35 DESIGN NOTE committed: docs/plans/legibility-audit-design.md. Position taken
        (coordinator ruling welcome): route polylines are DERIVED, not hand-authored —
        dellhollow.map.json's 38 typed walk edges ARE the intended route (the 315 walk
        meshes were generated from them and are wider by construction, which is the
        plan's own diagnosis), and cameras.json `owns.edges` (with @t0..t1 fractions)
        already says which route belongs to which shot. Generator
        tools/routes_derive.mjs reuses tools/cine_regions.mjs so ownership/projection
        have no second implementation; per-shot `overrides` keep it hand-editable;
        `--check` fails on staleness like cine_solve/scenegraph_derive. Generalises to
        Emberbrook and every future town with no authoring pass.
        Rubric: 6 measured signals (entry-visible / exit-visible / exit-flow /
        route-visible / route-distinct / no-fall-off) then the user's question;
        occlusion measured by gl.readPixels against the shot's own baked depth, not
        judged by eye. Fix buckets 1-4 incl. model re-architecture.

## TOWN CUSTODIAN

14:40 BASELINES + DESIGN NOTE. Region baselines taken BEFORE touching anything
        (region 74,90,10,22):
        * master_walk_qa.py — 367/367 identity bit-identical (worst vertex delta
          0.000e+00); ray coverage 242 samples, 239 on a walk mesh (98.76%), 19
          buried skipped; FAILED (2) ALREADY, both pre-existing: non-walk first
          hits e_lockhead__lock-five_rung00 x3, headroom lm_lockhead x4 (1.65%)
          + e_lockhead__lock-five_rung00 x3 (1.24%). 296 walks render-hidden
          town-wide.
        * geometry_audit.py — 73 meshes in region, 18 bbox-overlapping pairs,
          0 intersection offenders, 0 strays.
        DESIGN NOTE committed: docs/plans/lockhead-station-design.md. The
        measurement it adds to lockhead-prep.md: with walk_/bar_/lm_ masked, the
        route's NORTH half (approach + pad, y>15.6) and the WHOLE descending route
        to the Keepers' Cottage (..._l0..l5) hang 1..3.7 m over bare lf_ground with
        no art at all. So the "ribbon debt" is not a 10-line flag — hiding those
        ribbons without structure would swap a gray ribbon for INVISIBLE FLOOR over
        a 12 m drop. Paying it with structure: lk_paving (bedded half), lk_planking/
        lk_joists/lk_bearers (the jetty the parcel camera's own note describes),
        lk_boardwalk (the cottage descent), lk_bankface (cut-bank revetment + kerb),
        lk_rail (rim rail, VISUAL, gap at the ladder head), lk_station/lk_mast/
        lk_bell/lk_brazier (Odessa's post, NOT enterable, no map change needed),
        lk_clut, veg_lk_*, two 680 W practicals.
