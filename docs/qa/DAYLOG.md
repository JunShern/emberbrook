# DAYLOG — 2026-07-30 (day shift)

Timekeeping for the day slate, same convention as NIGHTLOG: every agent appends
timestamped milestones here (append-only; commit with your other files).

Slate (user-ratified this morning):
- COORDINATOR: combat-ecosystem design + schemas + state store; play3d.html
  gatekeeping; integration; final vertical-loop playtest.
- TOWN CUSTODIAN (sole master-blend owner today): lockhead station + empty-bank
  build, then legibility bucket-1 (rails/channeling) from audit findings.
- LEGIBILITY AUDITOR: route data + dev overlay + 18-shot audit + review page.
  Mandate includes proposing town-model re-architecture (user granted creative
  freedom; blend execution routes through the custodian).
- BATTLE CORE (T+design): rules layer, turn-based v1, router, encounter director.
- ECONOMY (T+design): shops, pause menu, save/load.

Canon set this morning: Odessa = senior lockkeeper (village-chief-like), lives at
Keepers' Cottage with daughter Maren; lockhead = her working STATION, not a hut.

------------------------------------------------------------
10:5x COORDINATOR: slate launched. Character canon fixed in map (Odessa+Maren at
      Keepers' Cottage, lockhead = staffed post; commit c15fff5). Design spine
      committed (e964e80): combat-ecosystem.md, rules data (6 monsters keyed to
      zones, 14 items, per-zone encounter tables w/ safe roads, growth curve
      k=25 w/ Vesper+Maren party-of-N, 3 shops), GS state store, play3d module
      hooks (game_state.js + route_overlay.js stub). Slice regression with hooks
      live: 532/0. FOUR AGENTS RUNNING: town custodian (lockhead station +
      empty-bank build), legibility auditor (routes/overlay/audit), battle core
      (rules kernel + turn-based v1 + encounter director), economy (shops +
      menu + save). All under design-first orders; check-ins on the 10-min tick
      cadence.

## LEGIBILITY AUDITOR

14:35 DESIGN NOTE committed: docs/plans/legibility-audit-design.md. Position taken
        (coordinator ruling welcome): route polylines are DERIVED, not hand-authored —
        dellhollow.map.json's 38 typed walk edges ARE the intended route (the 315 walk
        meshes were generated from them and are wider by construction, which is the
        plan's own diagnosis), and cameras.json `owns.edges` (with @t0..t1 fractions)
        already says which route belongs to which shot. Generator
        tools/routes_derive.mjs reuses tools/cine_regions.mjs so ownership/projection
        have no second implementation; per-shot `overrides` keep it hand-editable;
        `--check` fails on staleness like cine_solve/scenegraph_derive. Generalises to
        Emberbrook and every future town with no authoring pass.
        Rubric: 6 measured signals (entry-visible / exit-visible / exit-flow /
        route-visible / route-distinct / no-fall-off) then the user's question;
        occlusion measured by gl.readPixels against the shot's own baked depth, not
        judged by eye. Fix buckets 1-4 incl. model re-architecture.
